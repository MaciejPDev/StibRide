# Stib Ride

A Java project made for one of my courses at HE2B-ESI.

A JavaFx application that allows to calculate the shortest route between two stations on the STIB network. The application also implements a CRUD to manage favorites routes.

It uses the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two stations.

There are still things that can be optimized.

Design Pattern : MVP along with Observer/Observable
